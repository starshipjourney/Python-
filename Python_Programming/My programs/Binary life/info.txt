Binary Life is an interesting small script that focuses on using randomness to generate a simulation.
We can tweak some of its parameters to generate different outcomes.

The idea starts simple and gains complexity with additional functions introduced: a binary defined as “X1” travels through the NumPy matrix in search of food. 
the food is represented by “F” and a number that represents how much food is available at that particular point (example:” F23”). 
As our binary travels through the matrix, it loses health and needs food to replenish lost health. 
If binary has exceeding amount of health, then it stays at the point taking rest for a few seconds. 
As food is generated randomly there is possibility of more or less food being generated alike. 
If our binary manages to survive a certain amount of time it evolves and gains additional health. 
During the search process random incidents may also happen those effects our binaries health. 

Our output will show the binary travelling through the matrix and incidents occurring as it moves. 
Finally, our result will be produced on how long the binary survived and how much it has evolved.


Comments are made in code for reference. Additional functions can be added that would make much more impact and introduced wider scenarios in the Binaries life.
